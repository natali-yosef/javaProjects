For the first part I defined a new class called 'SingleChar'.
For every char in the array chars, there is brightness value for the char, and the normalized value.
For efficiency I saved the parameters for the brightness value (pixelForBrightness, fontForBrightness),
and the parameters for the normalized value (minForNormalize, maxForNormalize), in order not to need
calculate them over and over again.
with the information of the second part, I could defined a map.

In my opinion it was the right design template for the project because every char has is own
 brightness value and normalized value.

For the second part we used with hash map collection for the sub images and hash set
collection for saving the chars.

I added png file with ascii image named 'squidwardAscii.png'.

algorithms:
    1) run time is O(n) and O(1) memory.
    2) run time is O(n) , n represent the sum of all the words lens.
